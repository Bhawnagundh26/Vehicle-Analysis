This interactive dashboard is created using R programming language and displays insights from the Vehicle Failure Dataset. The dataset contains information about vehicle failures reported by different car manufacturers. The dashboard allows users to visualize the data and explore various factors that contribute to vehicle failure, such as the model of the car, the type of failure, and the location of the failure.

The dashboard provides multiple interactive charts and visualizations, such as bar charts, pie charts, and maps, to present the data in an intuitive and easy-to-understand manner. Users can select different filters and parameters to customize the dashboard and view specific insights. For example, users can select a particular car manufacturer or model to view its failure rate and the types of failures it commonly experiences.

Additionally, the dashboard includes interactive features such as hover effects and drill-down options to provide users with more detailed information and insights. It also allows users to download the data in different formats such as CSV or Excel for further analysis.

Overall, this interactive dashboard using R and the Vehicle Failure Dataset provides an engaging and insightful way to explore and understand the factors that contribute to vehicle failures, and can be a valuable tool for car manufacturers, mechanics, and anyone interested in the automotive industry.
-> The dynamic dashboard created to visually observe the car failures in the United states.
-> Statistics in vehicle failure analysis is a crucial process behind how we make decisions based on data, and make predictions.
-> I have represented data in the form of pie chart, bar plot, box plot and also used colour maps to visualize the region-wise vehicle failure in the country as per the dataset.
